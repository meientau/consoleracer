The simplest game ever as a kata.

When I had got my first computer, I switched it on, and it said:

![Atari 600XL says: Ready](ready.png)

I could type `PRINT "HELLO WORLD"` and hit ENTER, and the feeling of having an
impact on my environment would make me giggle. Seriously, you should try this,
too.

The next step up would be to buy a magazine (yes, made out of dead trees) and
type in the
["listing of the month"](https://archive.org/details/Happy.Computer.N10.1984.08-KCz/page/n41/mode/2up).

Try it with these very simple examples.  It could be an easy way to learn a
new language.  Look at the code before you type it in and try to figure out
what it does.  Type it in and enjoy all the typos you made and how your IDE
is highlighting them.  Take this as opportunity to practice looking at text
very closely, making every semicolon count.

Then run the code to see if your guess was correct.  If you are so inclined,
giggle :-)

Hint: Use keys `A` and `D` to control the "car".

Can you ... ?

 * Find bugs and fix them
 * Let difficulty increase over time
 * Implement the same in another language
 * Start over and write the whole program from memory
 * Make it more readable
 * Make it shorter
 * Make it more efficient
 * Add fancy graphics
